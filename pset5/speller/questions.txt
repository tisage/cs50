0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?

    an invented long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?

    getrusage() returns resource usage measures for who, which can be one of the following:
        RUSAGE_SELF
            Return resource usage statistics for the calling process, which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the process.
            
2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?

    16 members:
        The resource usages are returned in the structure pointed to by usage, which has the following form:
               struct rusage {
                   struct timeval ru_utime; /* user CPU time used */
                   struct timeval ru_stime; /* system CPU time used */
                   long   ru_maxrss;        /* maximum resident set size */
                   long   ru_ixrss;         /* integral shared memory size */
                   long   ru_idrss;         /* integral unshared data size */
                   long   ru_isrss;         /* integral unshared stack size */
                   long   ru_minflt;        /* page reclaims (soft page faults) */
                   long   ru_majflt;        /* page faults (hard page faults) */
                   long   ru_nswap;         /* swaps */
                   long   ru_inblock;       /* block input operations */
                   long   ru_oublock;       /* block output operations */
                   long   ru_msgsnd;        /* IPC messages sent */
                   long   ru_msgrcv;        /* IPC messages received */
                   long   ru_nsignals;      /* signals received */
                   long   ru_nvcsw;         /* voluntary context switches */
                   long   ru_nivcsw;        /* involuntary context switches */
               };
               
3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?

    Because passing a pointer reference will avoid stack overflow issue.

4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.

    The key aspect of the for loop is the c = fgetc(fp) function call. 
        
    fgetc gets the next character (an unsigned char) from fp and advances the position indicator in fp until the end of the file (EOF) is reached. 
            
    As each character is received, it is put through an if(if)-elseif-elseif logical sequence. 
    
    Summarizing the sequence: 
    1) If the character is an alphabetical character or an apostrophe that is not at index 0 of the word, the character is appended to the word array. 
        
    2) Else if the character is numerical, the word is ignored and we skip ahead to the next word (which is found after a space). 
        
    3) Else if we hit a space or punctuation, we must have found a whole word so we terminate the word by adding \0 to the word array.
    
5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? 
    Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
    
    fscanf read until white-space, but fgetc read line by line.

6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?

    const means that something is not modifiable, so a data object that is declared with const as a part of its type specification 
    must not be assigned to in any way during the run of a program. 
    
    It is very likely that the definition of the object will contain an initializer, but this is not always the case. 
    
    For example, if you were accessing a hardware port at a fixed memory address and promised only to read from it, 
    then it would be declared to be const but not initialized.

    In this example, dictionary and text we are trying to read should be it a fixed memory address. We only read from it and not change it in our program.
